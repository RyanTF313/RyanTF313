# Tic-Tac-Toe-Magic-Square-

A tic-tac-toe game for a user to play against someone else or themselves. Recently learned of "magic squre" so I wanted to try and implement the logic in a 3x3 game board. Magic square is a square grid filled with distinct positive integers in the range such that each cell contains a different integer and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal.
